1Discuss why the sums in hw5_sumsmall.c is different.

The sum calculate from 1 to 10,000 is 1.644725322723389
The sum calculate from 10,000 to 1 is 1.644834041595459

Because when n is small, there is less decimal, when do summation, some decimal is ignored, thus resulting a smaller number when adding from 1 to 10,000.
